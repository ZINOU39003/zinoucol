## 1. Probing Methodology & Verification Framework

To systematically verify signals without false positives or synthetic defaults, property investigation follows a disciplined eight-step methodology:

1. **Origin Identification**: Classifies the candidate source:
   * *Symbol match*: Exported constants in `android.car.jar` (proves symbol existence only).
   * *Directed diff*: Comparing pre/post `Discovery.snapshot` state captures across isolated hardware operations.
   * *OEM decompile*: Extracting exact `functionId`, `areaType`, and resolution logic from disassembled OEM applications.
   * *Direct OBD2*: Querying ECU registers directly via UDS commands over CAN.
2. **Registration Verification (`CONFIGCHECK`)**: Queries `CarPropertyManager.getPropertyList()` and range declarations. A degenerate range (`min=max=0`) indicates unpopulated hardware. Note that certain valid properties (e.g. `SEAT_OCCUPANCY`, `DOOR_POS`) bypass `getPropertyList()` enumeration but answer validly via typed accessors (`getFloatProperty`, `getIntProperty`).
3. **Property Scope (Area-Indexed vs. Scalar)**:
   * *Area-Indexed*: Requires querying explicit bitmasks (doors: 1, 4, 16, 64; windows: 16, 64, 256, 1024; seats: 1, 4, 16, 32, 64).
   * *Scalar*: Global powertrain and trip metrics operate on Area `0`. Querying additional areas on scalar properties yields redundant results.
4. **Resolution via Wrapper (`WRAPREAD`)**: Geely adaptation layer `functionId`s must be resolved via `CarAccess.wrapFuncId(funcId, areaType)` prior to invoking `CarPropertyManager`. Direct reads using raw function IDs query incorrect registers.
5. **Predefined Semantics & Units**: Physical units, quantization steps, and scaling formulas must be established before reading to differentiate genuine telemetry from uninitialized memory buffers.
6. **Cross-Validation with OEM UI**: Comparing readouts against live OEM dashboard indicators (`com.flyme.auto.energy`, `com.flyme.auto.hvac`, cluster displays) confirms calibration alignment.
7. **Physical Actuation for Writable (RW) Properties**: Software write verification requires:
   * Baseline read.
   * Property write dispatch.
   * Settling delay for mechanical or electrical transition.
   * Independent follow-up read and direct physical confirmation (actuator movement, relay click, dash icon).
8. **Dynamic State Logging**: Properties such as power flow, energy consumption, and cruise states report `0.0` or `null` while stationary. Validation requires continuous logging during active driving or fast charging.

### Diagnostic Command Interface

```bash
# Full property sweep snapshot
adb shell am broadcast -n com.geely.drivemem/.BootReceiver -a com.geely.drivemem.DISCOVER

# Direct property write
adb shell am broadcast -n com.geely.drivemem/.BootReceiver -a com.geely.drivemem.WRITEPROP --ei prop <id> --ei area <area> --ei val <int_val>
adb shell am broadcast -n com.geely.drivemem/.BootReceiver -a com.geely.drivemem.WRITEPROP --ei prop <id> --ei area <area> --ef fval <float_val>

# Read-only query
adb shell am broadcast -n com.geely.drivemem/.BootReceiver -a com.geely.drivemem.READPROP --es props "<id1,id2>" --es areas "<a1,a2>"
```

Status Key:
* ✅ **Confirmed**: Verified live on vehicle hardware with observable effect or validated telemetry.
* 🟢 **Validated Read**: Confirmed state reporting, write actuation pending further verification.
* 🟡 **Candidate**: Theoretical or decompile lead, unverified on hardware.
* 🔴 **Dead / Unwired**: Declared in software tables but unpopulated or rejected by physical vehicle hardware.
* ⚪ **NOOP / Inert**: Accepts commands without error but produces no physical actuation.

| `606109184` | `float` | 0 | R | `DRIVE_MAXIMUM_ELECTIC_POWER_LIMIT`. Dead (returns `0.0` during active power taper) | 🔴 |

### Fast Charging (DCFC) Detection Logic

To distinguish DC fast charging from AC charging reliably across power tapering curves:
* **Mains AC Charging**: Current $\le 32	ext{ A}$, voltage $pprox 220	ext{--}245	ext{ V}$.
* **DC Fast Charging**: Pack voltage $\ge 250	ext{ V}$ (consistently $380	ext{--}415	ext{ V}$), current up to $50	ext{ A}$. Pack voltage threshold cleanly separates modes even when DCFC current tapers at high SoC.

## 5. Drive Modes & Dynamics

| Property ID | Type | Area | Access | Values / Semantics | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `570491136` | `int` | 0, 1 | RW | Drive mode: Eco=`570491137`, Comfort=`570491138`, Sport=`570491139`. Holds persistently when vehicle is in ready/driving state | 🟢 |
| `537003264` | `int` | 0, 1 | RW | Regenerative braking: Low=`537003265`, Mid=`537003266`, High=`537003267` | ✅ |

| `557885465` | `int` | 0 | RW | Comfortable Stop (smooth braking deceleration): `1`=ON, `0`=OFF | ✅ |

## 6. Cruise Control & ADAS

| Property ID | Type | Area | Access | Values / Semantics | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `557884450` | `float` | 0 | R | Cruise control state: `0.0` = OFF, `1.0` = ARMED, `7.0` = ACTIVE | 🟢 |
| `557887630` | `int` | 0 | R | Cruise control state (integer alias, tracks identical enum values) | 🟢 |
| `289408009` | `int` | 0 | R | Standard ACC status (`0x11400409`). Constant `4` (unwired) | 🔴 |
| `557875204` | `float` | 0 | R | Radar target distance: drops to `-1.0` when no lead vehicle detected | 🟡 |
| `557884437` | `int` | 0 | RW | Lane Departure Warning: `1` = ON, `2` = OFF (requires modal confirmation on disable) | ✅ |
| `557884439` | `float` | 0 | RW | Lane Departure Warning status echo: `1.0` = ON, `0.0` = OFF | ✅ |
| `557858878` | `boolean` | 0 | RW | Forward Collision Warning (FCW): `true` = ON, `false` = OFF | ✅ |
| `557858879` | `int` | 0 | RW | FCW Sensitivity: `0`=Disabled, `0x200e0201`=Late, `0x200e0202`=Medium, `0x200e0203`=Early | ✅ |
| `557858874` | `boolean` | 0 | RW | AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) master switch: `true` = ON, `false` = OFF. Distinct from FCW above — this is the active-braking system, FCW is only the alert. Turning it off also forces FCW off (557858878 → `false`, 557858879 → `0`) and grays out the FCW row in the OEM UI. **The OEM UI re-arms this to ON on every vehicle power-on** — confirmed both by the on-screen warning text and by matching `AEB_PROP_ID`/`KEY_AEB_RESTORE_ON_BOOT` in a decompiled reference app (`backup-centralex/jadx-out`, package `com.ex.auto`), which keeps it off across power cycles by rewriting it after boot. Verified via directed diff (OEM ADAS screen toggle) and via a direct write from `modehelper` (`setBooleanProperty`, no `SecurityException`, readback confirmed the change, then restored) — both 2026-09-12. Writing it this way bypasses the OEM UI's own confirmation dialog entirely (that dialog is enforced client-side in the settings app, not at the property layer). Write access from Drive Assist itself (not platform-signed) remains untested | ✅ |
| `557887557` | `int` | 0 | RW | Leading Vehicle Departing Alert: `1` = ON, `0` = OFF | ✅ |

---

## 6a. AVAS (Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System)

Not to be confused with ADAS above — AVAS is the low-speed pedestrian
warning sound, a completely different system with a different control
path. The OEM Settings "Som" screen only exposes which *tune* plays
(`Clássico` / `Tom Galático` / `Caminhada Espacial`, a plain `int`
`CarPropertyManager` property) — it never shows a mute/off control at all,
for any tune.

Muting is a separate call, not a property write: `android.car.media.CarAudioManager`
(a hidden framework class, reached by reflection — `getCarManager("audio")`,
confirmed real by decompiling the reference app, see `CarAccess.audioCall()`
in `drivemem`) exposes `getAVASMode()` / `setAVASMode(int)`, where `0` =
muted and `>=1` = the active mode. This is the mechanism the reference app
(`backup-centralex/jadx-out`, `KEY_AVAS_MUTED`) uses for its own AVAS mute
toggle — not a Settings-app UI patch.

**Confirmed 2026-09-12, live from `modehelper`:** `isAVASModeSupported()` →
`true`; baseline `getAVASMode()` → `1`; `setAVASMode(0)` muted it (readback
confirmed `0`); `setAVASMode(1)` restored it (readback confirmed `1`). No
`SecurityException` — unlike the identical call attempted from Drive Assist
itself, which fails with `requires permission
android.car.permission.CAR_CONTROL_AUDIO_VOLUME`. Same pattern as the AEB
property write: the platform-signed helper can do it, the normal app can't.

## 10. Direct OBD2 UDS Parameter Identifiers (BMS ECU `0x7E2`)

Diagnostics querying the high-voltage Battery Management System directly over CAN via a paired Bluetooth ELM327 adapter:

### Bus Initialization Sequence

```

### Parameter Identifiers (Service `0x22` - ReadDataByIdentifier)

| Metric | PID Command | Response Length | Decoding Formula (Bytes A, B, C...) | Units / Range |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **State of Charge (SoC)** | `22 4B 36` | 2 bytes | `(A * 256 + B) / 10.0` | 0.0 to 105.0% (0.1% precision) |
| **Pack Voltage** | `22 4B 21` | 2 bytes | `(A * 256 + B) / 10.0` | 200.0 to 500.0 V |
| **Pack Current** | `22 4B 22` | 2 bytes | `((A * 256 + B) - 5000) / 10.0` | Amperes (+ discharge, - charge) |
| **Battery Avg Temp** | `22 4B 48` | 1 byte | `A - 40` | °C (observed 17--22 °C) |
| Battery Max Cell Temp | `22 4B 23` | 1 byte | `A - 40` | °C (not read by the app) |
| Battery Min Cell Temp | `22 4B 25` | 1 byte | `A - 40` | °C (not read by the app) |
| Cell # of Max / Min Temp | `22 4B 24` / `22 4B 26` | 1 byte | `A` | index (not read by the app) |
| Coolant Inlet Temp (probably) | `22 4B C2` | 1 byte | `A - 40` | °C (not read by the app) |
| Charging Socket Temp | `22 4B DA` | 1 byte | `A - 40` | °C (not read by the app) |
| ~~`4B3C`~~ | `22 4B 3C` | 1 byte | **not a temperature** | do not use |
| **Vehicle Speed** | `22 DF 01` | 1 byte | `A` | 0 to 255 km/h |
| **Instantaneous Power** | *(Calculated)* | - | `(Voltage * Current) / 1000.0` | Kilowatts (kW) |

**Battery temperature is `4B48`, `A - 40`.** The temperature DIDs came
from a Car Scanner ("Geely Geometry C" profile) communication log on
2026-09-28, 07:33, 20 °C outside: `4B48`, `4B23`, `4B25` and `4BC2` all
answered `0x3D` (21 °C) and `4BDA` `0x3C` (20 °C). Car Scanner labels them
"Average", "Max. cell", "Min. cell", "Inlet" and "Charging socket", but it
shows max/min/inlet as -9.5 °C (it scales them `A * 0.5 - 40`, wrongly).
Which of `4B48`/`4BC2` is the average was settled from 892 polling rounds in
the same log: `4B48` lies between min (`4B25`) and max (`4B23`) in 97% of
them, `4BC2` is below the minimum in 28% -- the pattern of a coolant inlet.
`4B1C`, `4B85` and `4B8A` answer `7F 22 31` (not supported).

**`4B3C` is not a temperature**, under any offset. It was used first as
`A - 40` (gave -11 °C on a 22 °C day, 2026-09-24), then as `A` (looked right
at 29--32 °C, then climbed 27 -> 80 over three days, fell only 62 -> 56 over
a parked night, and read 67 on the 20 °C morning above). Every
`battery_temp_c` stored 2026-09-13..28 was that byte; CarDb v23 clears them,
first copying their "OBD2 was connected" meaning into `energy_measured`.

The reader writes a logcat warning (tag `DriveMem`) outside `-30..70 °C`;
that exposes a bad response or scaling change without concealing diagnostic evidence.
